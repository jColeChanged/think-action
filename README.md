# think-action

This project is about rethinking discovery of available actions in the context 
of software engineering IDEs by taking inspiration from modern video games. 
My aim is to solve the problem of only the elite sage guru ninjas of vim knowing 
how to use their editor effectively. My path toward solving this problem is to 
try not to make software that hates and despises the very idea of a normal person 
being capable of mastering the UX so as to become power users.
